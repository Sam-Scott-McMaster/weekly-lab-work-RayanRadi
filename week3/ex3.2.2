a) The script takes one argument ($1) and executes it as a command.
If I pass a command like (ls -l) as an argument to the script, it 
will execute the (ls -l) command. The command to execute ls-l if 
the script is called "di" would be: ./di "ls -l"

b)Initial Guess: "a" "1" "a1C" "1*10" 
overall: "a 1 a1C 1*10"
Output: a 1 a1c 1*10
