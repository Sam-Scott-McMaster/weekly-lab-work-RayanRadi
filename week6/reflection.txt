Reflection on the use of the & operator for side effects:

In the lab the digits function uses pointer parameters
to chang the max and min values outside its scope. This 
creates side effects by allowing the function to modify external
variables. This can be useful for efficiency and not having to re define
the function over and over again, but it also makes
functions less predictable as they can change values outside 
their local scope, and if you want to do things to those values 
multiple times you have to know in your head what would happen to them since
you cant re-initialize the values you manually inputed after every time a function is 
run and those values are changed. They change for good (during the runtime of the code).
