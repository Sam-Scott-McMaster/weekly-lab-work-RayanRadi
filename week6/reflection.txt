Reflection on the use of the & operator for side effects:

In the lab the digits function uses pointer parameters
to chang the max and min values outside its scope. This 
creates side effects by allowing the function to modify external
variables. This can be useful for efficiency, but it also makes
functions less predictable as they can change values outside 
their local scope.
