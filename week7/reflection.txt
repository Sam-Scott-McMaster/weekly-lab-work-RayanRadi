In C you can treat an array as an indexed data structure and process it with the [] operator, or you
can treat it as a pointer into memory and process it with the * operator and pointer arithmetic. What
is one advantage you can see to processing using pointer arithmetic. What is one disadvantage?
Which style of coding do you prefer and why?

Using pointer arithmetic in C can make code faster since it avoids extra indexing steps and provides direct memory access. 
However, it can make the code harder to read and debug, especially for beginners. Personally, I prefer using array 
indexing for clarity, but I see the benefits of pointers for performance in more complex tasks.
